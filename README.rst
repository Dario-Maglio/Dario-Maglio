Hi!
My username is @Dario-Maglio; I live in Naples (Italy) and study Physics at the University of Pisa. I enjoy exploring Art and Culture, and I believe in guaranteeing 'Open Knowledge <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_knowledge>'_ and 'Curiosity-Driven Learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_knowledge>'_ as a pathway to a better society. I also like to question labels and fundamental concepts, even if I am building analogies between totally different things.



In short, what can I currently say about myself:
------------------------------------------------

- 🏫 I am writing my Master's Thesis at the University of Helsinki.
- 👀 I am interested in Quantum Fields Theory and Statistical Physics.
- 🌱 I am learning numerical methods for ML and QMC simulations.  
- 📫 How to reach me: cafasso.dario@gmail.com, d.cafasso@studenti.unipi.it.



What can I say about myself in general:
---------------------------------------

Living seems to me as continuously (and discontinuously) **changing perspective about the world**, trying to catch the harmony between an uncountable number of relationships, **forever looking for a permanent centre of gravity**. The existence of such a final picture is not guaranteed, but the game of survivance - driven by natural selection - has made us capable of enjoying learning, while playing with the world's building blocks. With this in mind, I like to read books, watch movies and listen to music to experience and understand something little and new about life. I keep track of my updates and make lists of related items with several apps, which also help me discover and share. I also like to learn to speak new languages and play musical instruments. Sometimes I play chess and Go with my friends. Finally, I love to hike in natural landscapes. I'm addicted to them, espresso and spontaneity.

*EUGENIO MONTALE, Ossi di seppia* (Torino, Piero Gobetti Editore 1925)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

*Ciò che di me sapeste*
*non fu che la scialbatura,*
*la tonaca che riveste*
*la nostra umana ventura.*

*Ed era forse oltre il telo*
*l'azzurro tranquillo;*
*vietava il limpido cielo*
*solo un sigillo.*

*O vero c'era il falòtico*
*mutarsi della mia vita,*
*lo schiudersi d'un'ignita*
*zolla che mai vedrò.*

*Restò così questa scorza*
*la vera mia sostanza;*
*il fuoco che non si smorza*
*per me si chiamò: l'ignoranza.*

*Se un'ombra scorgete, non è*
*un'ombra - ma quella io sono.*
*Potessi spiccarla da me,*
*offrirvela in dono.*
