Hi 👋 My username is @Dario-Maglio

I live in Naples 🇮🇹 and study Physics at the University of Pisa  🔭



What can I say about myself - in short
--------------------------------------

I enjoy exploring Art, Culture, Nature and Science, and I believe in guaranteeing `Open Knowledge <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_knowledge>`_ and `Curiosity-Driven Learning <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-7Oukm8bDf75-9ajAKiZYQsuOY8gdQpQ/view?usp=share_link>`_ as a pathway to a better society. I also like to question labels and fundamental concepts, even  when I am catching analogies between totally different things.

Currently:

- 🏫 I am writing my Master's Thesis at the University of Helsinki.
- 👀 I am interested in Quantum Field Theory and Statistical Physics.
- 🌱 I am learning numerical methods for ML and QMC simulations.

What can I say about myself - in general
----------------------------------------

Living seems to me as continuously (and discontinuously) **changing perspective about the world**, trying to catch the harmony between an uncountable number of relationships, **forever looking for a permanent centre of gravity**. The existence of such a final picture is not guaranteed, but the game of survivance - driven by natural selection - has made us capable of enjoying learning, while playing with the world's building blocks. 

With this in mind, I like to read books, watch movies and listen to music to experience and understand something little and new about life. I keep track of my updates and make lists of related items with several apps, which also help me discover and share. I also like to learn to speak new languages and play musical instruments. Sometimes I play chess and Go with my friends. Finally, I love to hike in natural landscapes. I'm addicted to them, espresso and spontaneity.

*EUGENIO MONTALE, Ossi di seppia* (Torino, Piero Gobetti Editore 1925)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

*Ciò che di me sapeste*

*non fu che la scialbatura,*

*la tonaca che riveste*

*la nostra umana ventura.*

|

*Ed era forse oltre il telo*

*l'azzurro tranquillo;*

*vietava il limpido cielo*

*solo un sigillo.*

|

*O vero c'era il falòtico*

*mutarsi della mia vita,*

*lo schiudersi d'un'ignita*

*zolla che mai vedrò.*

|

*Restò così questa scorza*

*la vera mia sostanza;*

*il fuoco che non si smorza*

*per me si chiamò: l'ignoranza.*

|

*Se un'ombra scorgete, non è*

*un'ombra - ma quella io sono.*

*Potessi spiccarla da me,*

*offrirvela in dono.*
