Hi 👋 My name is Dario Cafasso Maglio

I live in Avellino 🇮🇹 and study Physics at the University of Pisa  🔭



What I can say about myself - in short
--------------------------------------

I enjoy exploring nature and traveling, coming into contact with different cultures and discovering more about my own as well. I also enjoy exploring different forms of art expression and understanding the role of science in them and in society. I often question labels and fundamental concepts in search of biases and logical fallacies, even supporting arguments I don't really believe in. Finally, I play to grasp and support analogies between very different phenomena.

The resulting curiosity and wonder are enough to convince me of the need to ensure `Open Knowledge <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_knowledge>`_ ,  `Curiosity Driven Learning <https://github.com/Dario-Maglio/Curiosity_Driven_Learning>`_ and accessibility of educational tools for an advancement toward a more inclusive and sustainable society.

- 🏫 I am writing my Master's Thesis on Quantum Time and the PaW Mechanism.
- 👀 My interests are Relativistic Quantum Field Theory and Statistical Physics.
- 🌱 I am also learning numerical methods for Machine Learning and Monte Carlo simulations.

What I can say about myself - in general
----------------------------------------

Living seems like a continuous **change of perspective about the world**, trying to capture the harmony among an uncountable number of relationships, and  **always looking for a permanent center of gravity**. Its existence is not guaranteed, but the game of survival - driven by natural selection - has made us capable of enjoying learning, playing with the building blocks of the world. 

With this in mind, I like to read books, watch movies and listen to music to experience and understand something little and new about life. I really enjoy the works of Milan Kundera, Federico Fellini and Franco Battiato, just to mention some. I keep track of my updates and make lists of related items with several apps, which also help me discover and share. I also like to learn new languages and play musical instruments. Sometimes I play chess and Go with my friends. Finally, I love to hike in natural landscapes. I'm addicted to the beauty of nature, espresso and spontaneity.

*EUGENIO MONTALE, Ossi di seppia* (Torino, Piero Gobetti Editore 1925)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

*Ciò che di me sapeste*

*non fu che la scialbatura,*

*la tonaca che riveste*

*la nostra umana ventura.*

|

*Ed era forse oltre il telo*

*l'azzurro tranquillo;*

*vietava il limpido cielo*

*solo un sigillo.*

|

*O vero c'era il falòtico*

*mutarsi della mia vita,*

*lo schiudersi d'un'ignita*

*zolla che mai vedrò.*

|

*Restò così questa scorza*

*la vera mia sostanza;*

*il fuoco che non si smorza*

*per me si chiamò: l'ignoranza.*

|

*Se un'ombra scorgete, non è*

*un'ombra - ma quella io sono.*

*Potessi spiccarla da me,*

*offrirvela in dono.*
